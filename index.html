                   <span class="why">prior exp</span>
                    <br>
                   i realized i wanted a gameboy after playing pokemon leafgreen on my cousin's. i had no interest or knowledge in literally any other game at the time; i really just wanted to play pokemon. also, being able to beat my brother at this game was a definite reason to buy.
                    </div>

                <div class="ip" id="3dsd"><strong>3ds</strong>
                   <span class="why">nostalgia, characters</span>
                    <br>
                     i was on the fence about buying a 3ds when it first came out, but i ended up purchasing one after kingdom hearts dream drop distance was announced. i had played kh games that i rented from the library on my ps2, and i had a crush on one of the characters.</div>

                <div class="ip" id="switchd"><strong>switch</strong>
                   <span class="why">nostalgia</span>
                    <br>
                    i decided to buy my switch after animal crossing was finally announced. i actually cried during the announcement. i would literally die for animal crossing. i did have to wait until black friday to get a deal that would justify buying such an expensive system in college.</div>




                <div class="ip" id="macd"><strong>macbook air</strong>
                   <span class="why">peer pressure, design</span>
                    <br>
                    despite being very against macs before college, i caved and bought one during my freshman year at cmu (since i was only one of three with a pc). it's not very good for most video games, but i have over 100 hours of stardew valley on it now.</div>

                <div class="ip" id="rhd"><strong>rhythm heaven</strong>
                   <span class="why">style</span>
                    <br>
                    rhythm heaven was the first portable rhythm game i ever got into. the characters and art style are so cute i didn't even care what game it was. it's so colorful and cute i knew that it would make me happy just watching the initial trailers.</div>

                <div class="ip" id="acd"><strong>animal crossing new leaf</strong>
                   <span class="why">nostalgia, gameplay</span>
                    <br>
                    animal crossing was and is my favorite nintendo series by far. i had played my brother's copy of wild world on the ds, and i liked it so much i made him trade it to me for mario kart. after that, i bought and obsessed over the gamecube and wii versions.</div>


                <div class="ip" id="katamarid"><strong>katamari damacy reroll</strong>
                   <span class="why">nostalgia, style</span>
                    <br>
                    i purchased katamari damacy reroll for the switch because of my experience playing it on the ps2. i remember being interested in it because of its odd art style and direction, and how stupid and fun the characters seemed to be. </div>
                    
                               <div class="ip" id="ssbd"><strong>super smash bros brawl</strong>
                               <span class="why">nostalgia, characters</span>
                    <br>
                    although i've owned super smash bros on gamecube, wii, 3ds, and switch, the wii version was definitely my favorite. i think that one of the biggest selling point of the smash games is definitely the amount of characters included and the nostalgia that comes with it. </div>
